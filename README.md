## two-mern-social
1. backend-mern-social
1. frontend-mern-social

## backend-mern-social
1. 6b8aa4b /api/v2 added to /routes/auth, post, user
1. e8ad1b3 3333 /api/users/ get route OK
1. This corresponds to an older version. I will have to find the newer version with /v2/routes added circumventing the authorization/validation

## frontend-mern-social
1. 6f053d6 giving up on router v6
1. 810adb8 Migrating from mui 4 to 5 and react-router-dom to 6
1. 73f7f24 Initialize project using create React App.
1. Also older version. I will refactor to delete router, mui, and use vite react install

## chapter05-from-gen2-laptop
This is the most current running version. I am not sure what nodejs is running. It appears to be 13. Originally was 8. This version contains almost all additional version2 routes. The branches are:
1. baseline-nodejs-13.12.0-npm-6.14.4
1. chapter05
1. chapter05-pending
1. main
1. 0a
as well as remote for all except 0a.
1. npm run development
1. npm start: NODE_ENV=production is not recognized
1. npm run serve: failed at server script
1. only npm run development works: compiles 95 hidden modules, then 378 hidden modules
1. Currently is running branch chapter-5-pending
1. Check if it runs with chapter05 branch.
1. The problems when using other than 13 version are related to ssl: I added a ssl-legacy configuration


#### Keep this version to run when testing astro rendering from 
1. ~/Documents/hoque-shama/tested-tower app
