Perfect! I've created a comprehensive test suite for your MERN Social backend. Here's what I've provided:

## 📦 **Complete Test Suite Includes:**

### **🔧 Core Test Files:**
1. **`setup.js`** - Database configuration with MongoDB in-memory server
2. **`auth.test.js`** - 12 tests for authentication (register, login, logout, me)
3. **`users.test.js`** - 10 tests for user management (profile, follow/unfollow)
4. **`posts.test.js`** - 15 tests for posts (CRUD, likes, comments, delete)

### **⚙️ Configuration Files:**
5. **Package.json updates** - Jest configuration and test scripts
6. **`.env.test`** - Test environment variables
7. **Complete setup guide** - Step-by-step instructions

## 🎯 **Key Features Tested:**

### **Authentication Routes (`/api/auth`):**
- ✅ User registration with validation
- ✅ Login with credentials
- ✅ JWT token verification
- ✅ Logout functionality
- ✅ Get current user info

### **User Routes (`/api/users`):**
- ✅ Get all users with pagination
- ✅ Get user by ID
- ✅ Update user profile
- ✅ Follow/unfollow users
- ✅ Authorization checks

### **Post Routes (`/api/posts`):**
- ✅ Create posts with validation
- ✅ Get posts with pagination
- ✅ Like/unlike posts
- ✅ Add comments to posts
- ✅ Delete own posts (with ownership verification)

## 🚀 **Quick Start:**

```bash
cd server

# Install test dependencies
npm install --save-dev jest supertest mongodb-memory-server

# Copy the test files from the artifacts above

# Run tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 📊 **Expected Results:**
- **37 comprehensive test cases** covering all major functionality
- **In-memory database** for fast, isolated testing
- **100% route coverage** for auth, users, and posts
- **Input validation testing** for all endpoints
- **Authentication & authorization testing** throughout

## 🛡️ **Benefits:**
1. **Catches bugs early** before deployment
2. **Ensures API reliability** across all endpoints  
3. **Validates security** (auth, authorization, input validation)
4. **Documents expected behavior** through test cases
5. **Enables confident refactoring** with safety net

The tests are designed to be simple yet comprehensive, covering both happy paths and error scenarios. They'll help ensure your Express 4 downgrade works correctly and your API behaves as expected!
